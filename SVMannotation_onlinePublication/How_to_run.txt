generate the environment from the provided SVM.yml file #e.g. conda env create --name SVM --file /path/to/directory/SVM.yml (this step just needs to be done when running the script for the first time)
activate the SVM.yml conda environment #e.g. conda activate /path/to/directory/SVM
navigate to the directory where the CrossVal.ipynb and SVM.ipynb scripts can be found  #e.g. cd /path/to/directory
open the scripts in Jupyter notebook #e.g. jupyter notebook (and then open the scripts there)
adjust the paths in the jupyter notebook and run the chunks of code
 * means the code is busy running

The script CrossVal.ipynb performs the 5-fold cross-validation and produces Supplemental Figure 1i (Results > CrossVal > Confusion_matrix_SVM.png). 
The script SVM.ipynb trains the SVM annotation model and annotates the Rojahn et al. dataset. The most important output is the SVM_Pred_Labels.csv file in Results > RojanhBiop where the predicted KC annotations are stored.
